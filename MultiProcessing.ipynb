    "## Usefulness of Multiprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallelism: Multiprocessing enables the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks, improving overall program performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource Isolation: Each process has its own memory space, reducing the risk of data corruption and making it easier to implement parallel algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoiding Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Unlike multithreading, which is subject to the GIL in CPython, multiprocessing allows for parallel execution without the limitations imposed by the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improved Performance: For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing can significantly speed up the execution of tasks that can be parallelized.\n",
