    "    \n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "Inheritance is the mechanism that allows a class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass). The subclass can extend or override the attributes and methods of the superclass. Inheritance promotes reusability and hierarchy in class structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of representing essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows us to create abstract classes with abstract methods that define a common interface for subclasses. Abstraction helps in managing complexity by focusing on relevant attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to the data and allows controlled access through methods, promoting data hiding and protecting the internal state of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling one interface (method) to work with objects of various classes. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding, providing flexibility and extensibility in OOP.\n",
