    "Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages, parsing the HTML, and extracting the desired information. Web scraping can be done manually, but automated tools and scripts are often used to efficiently gather large amounts of data from websites.\n",

    "## Uses of Web Scrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection: Web scraping is used to collect data from websites that don't provide an API or have limited data export options.\n",
    "- Competitive Analysis: Businesses use web scraping to monitor competitors' prices, products, and strategies.\n",
    "- Research and Analysis: Researchers and analysts use web scraping to gather data for academic or market research.\n",
    "- Monitoring and Alerts: Web scraping is employed to monitor changes on websites and receive alerts for specific events.\n",
    "- Content Aggregation: Some services use web scraping to aggregate content from various sources for display on a single platform."
