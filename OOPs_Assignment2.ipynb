    "Abstraction is one of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and refers to the process of simplifying complex real-world entities into their essential characteristics. It allows you to represent only the relevant attributes and behaviors of an object while hiding unnecessary details from the user. In other words, abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it."

    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex objects by exposing only relevant attributes and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "It focuses on \"what\" an object does rather than \"how\" it does it, providing a high-level view of the object's essential characteristics.\n",
    "Abstraction is achieved using abstract classes and abstract methods, which define a common interface for a group of related objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit called a class.\n",
    "It hides the internal implementation details of a class from the outside world, making the class's internal state inaccessible directly.\n",
    "Encapsulation protects the integrity of the data by controlling access to it through methods (getters and setters) and prevents unauthorized changes."
