    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient data retrieval, manipulation, and management. Databases are used to store large amounts of structured or unstructured data, and they provide mechanisms for querying and accessing the stored information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL(Structured Query Language)\n",
    "SQL databases are based on a structured approach where data is stored in the form of tables. These databases are also referred to as relational databases because they establish relationships between tables using keys (usually primary and foreign keys). \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "## NOSQL(Not Only SQL)\n",
    "NoSQL databases, as the name suggests, do not rely on the traditional structured table-based schema used by SQL databases. Instead, they offer more flexibility by allowing data to be stored in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, column-family, or graphs. NoSQL databases are known for their ability to handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, making them well-suited for modern applications where data can vary significantly in structure.\n",

    "Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, and Neo4j.\n"

    "DDL is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to define and manage the structure of a database and its objects.

    "## Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a field in a database table that is used to establish a link between the data in two tables.

    "### Foreign keys serve the following purposes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintaining Referential Integrity: A foreign key ensures that the data being inserted or updated in one table corresponds to valid data in another table. It helps maintain data consistency and prevents orphaned or disconnected records.\n",
